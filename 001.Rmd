This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
subsetDataTWbank %>%
  mutate(
    年月=年月 %>%
      stringr::str_extract_all("[:digit:]+") %>%
      purrr::map_chr(
                 function(x) {
                   x1=as.integer(x[[1]])+1911
                   x[[1]]=as.character(x1)
                                stringr::str_c(x,collapse="-")
                 }
                 ),
    年月日=stringr::str_c(年月,"01",sep="-"),
    西元年月日=lubridate::ymd(年月日)
  )
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
